The Public Debt of a City Council is made up of the Financial Public Debt and the Commercial  Public Debt. This vocabulary represents the data of the Commercial Public Debt. The vocabulary of the Financial Public Debt can be consulted at http://vocab.ciudadesabiertas.es/def/economia/deuda-publica-financiera/index-es.html. The public debt of a city council is one of the main indicators of public accounts and helps to understand its economic situation. In macroeconomic terms, it is also a conditioning factor for spending, saving, public investment, and economic policy itself. Public debt is decisive for, for example, the preparation of budgets. Likewise, the level of public sector indebtedness is determined by the expenditure ceiling established according to Organic Law 2/2012, of April 27, on Budgetary Stability and Financial Sustainability (LOEPSF). Specifically, for local entities there is Royal Decree-Law 17/2014, of December 26, on financial sustainability measures of the autonomous communities and local entities and others of an economic nature. These regulations define several objectives related to budgetary stability, the most relevant of which is to guarantee the budgetary stability and financial sustainability of all Public Administrations, which means that all levels of Public Administrations are obliged to comply with the LOEPSF. 

Commercial public debt is aggregate data and includes data from the quarterly and monthly late payment reports that in turn include the Average Payment Period (PMP) data for the city council and its dependent entities. The global average monthly payment period is also represented.
